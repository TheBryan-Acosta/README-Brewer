## **Description**

Challenge 09 This Weeks challenge was to create a README Generator

### **What was developed**

A Professional readme markdown file creator, using node and the inquirer package to get user input and create a project readme.

### **Development** -

Using the inquirer package, I created prompts for the user to anwser, some fields are required like the title and description, some are optional. With those inputs I pass them into their respective function to construct a template literal with said data. Finally using nodes fs module to create a readme.md file in the dist directory from that template literal.

A sample of the README.md is contained inside the sample folder
